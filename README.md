soiltexture
===========

Homepage of the soiltexture R package.

The package repositry was recently moved from rforge to 
GitHub . Original pages:  
https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=740 
http://soiltexture.r-forge.r-project.org/

This page is under construction.

Please refer to the old homepage for more information.

User support:
-------------

My current work and personal situation unfortunately does not 
leave me much time to provide support to and answer questions 
from users of the soiltexture package. I prioritise the base 
maintenance of the package on CRAN, so that the package 
remains available on the latest version of R. Answer to other 
questions is likely to be erratic or very delayed.
